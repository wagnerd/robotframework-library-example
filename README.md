# Robot Framework Library Example

This project is used as a simple example for a RobotFramework library and contains some mechanisms I learned and I want to keep for the future :)

Feel free to reuse this repository for your own library projects!

This README is copied into the library package, so it should contain some information about the package and the usage.

It is also used as the `long_description` in [setup.cfg](setup.cfg) for the package.

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
